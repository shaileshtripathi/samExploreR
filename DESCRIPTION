Description: This R package is designed for subsampling procedure to
		simulate sequencing experiments with reduced sequencing depth.
		This package can be used to anlayze data generated from all
		major sequencing platforms such
        as Illumina GA/HiSeq/MiSeq, Roche GS-FLX, ABI SOLiD and
        LifeTech Ion PGM/Proton sequencers. It supports multiple
        operating systems incluidng Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD and
        Solaris.
		Was developed with usage of Rsubread 1.16.1
