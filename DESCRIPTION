Description: This R package is designed for subsampling procedure 
        to simulate sequencing experiments with reduced sequencing depth. 
        This package can be used to anlayze data generated from all major 
        sequencing platforms such as Illumina GA, HiSeq, 
        MiSeq, Roche GS-FLX, ABI SOLiD and LifeTech Ion 
        PGM Proton sequencers. It supports multiple operating systems 
        incluidng Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD and Solaris. 
        Was developed with usage of Rsubread.
